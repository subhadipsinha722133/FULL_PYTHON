# The `turtle.left(90)` function is used to turn the turtle (pen) to the left by 90 degrees. In this
# code, it is used to turn the turtle to create the sides of the rectangular box.
# The code `turtle.left(90)` is used to turn the turtle (pen) to the left by 90 degrees. This is done
# to change the direction in which the turtle moves.
